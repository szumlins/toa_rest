flask
flask_restful

Will only run on a Mac running ToolsOnAir Just:In Engine

There are only two settings, default service port for the REST service to run on and debug enabled.
Set the service_port in the app.py script to any open port not in use by other services on the Mac.
For production installs, disable debug.

To run, simply load required libraries and run ./app.py to fire up the API.
